# What is this for
It's just a mini databased of logos intended for just providing a means to host the images in the event someone needs them for an IPTV client.

# Legal Concerns
As these logos are likely protected by trademarks, I will not be using them for profit, however, if you can prove your a legal representive of one of the station owners and need to take something down, please contact me at [legal@typicalnerds.uk](mailto:legal@typicalnerds.uk)
